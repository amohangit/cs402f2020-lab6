2) Install Tomcat on the new instance:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk
wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.39/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.39.tar.gz
tar xzf apache-tomcat-9.0.39.tar.gz
sudo mv apache-tomcat-9.0.39 /usr/local/tomcat9
/usr/local/tomcat9/./bin/startup.sh

# test tomcat on port 8080
# change port 8080 to 80
nano /usr/local/tomcat9/conf/server.xml

sudo apt install authbind
sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/80 
sudo chmod 500 /etc/authbind/byport/80 
sudo chown ubuntu /etc/authbind/byport/80
nano /usr/local/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh
/*
Change in "/usr/local/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh"
OLD: 
exec "$PRGDIR"/"$EXECUTABLE" start "$@
NEW: 
exec authbind --deep "$PRGDIR"/"$EXECUTABLE" start "$@"
*/
/usr/local/tomcat9/./bin/shutdown.sh

3) Install AXIS2 on the new instance:

sudo apt install zip
cd /usr/local/tomcat9/webapps/
wget https://apache.claz.org/axis/axis2/java/core/1.7.9/axis2-1.7.9-war.zip
unzip axis2-1.7.9-war.zip
rm -rf axis2-1.7.9-war.zip 

# Test it using a browser on your local machine:
IPAddress/axis2/services/listServices

-----------------------------------------------------
4) Publish Service on Tomcat:

# Local Changes
Place your pem file in the server folder.
Edit server/move.sh file with correct pem name and ip address.
Execute move.sh file to copy the services folder to server.
Windows users, please execute the command manually.

# Server
cd /home/ubuntu/dob-service
./publish.sh
# After one minute the service will be published on the tomcat as a web service. A new WSDL will be available. Test it using a browser on your local machine:
IPAddress/axis2/services/listServices
-----------------------------------------------------

5) Consume Services on Tomcat using Java:
# Local Changes
Edit client/dob-client/driver.sh file with correct wsdl. [use backslash to escape ? literal in the URL]
Execute driver.sh file to consume the web service as a client. 

Windows users, please use driver.bat file.


# If Java_Home is not set, then this may throw an error. We need to run the following commands to set the Java_Home for linux/mac users. Please use the correct jdk version and path on your laptop.  

export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-13.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home
nano ~/.bash_profile 
source ~/.bash_profile
echo $JAVA_HOME

-----------------------------------------------------
6) Consume Services on Tomcat using Python (zeep library), that is cross compatibility (Python-Java)
# Local Changes
Edit client/dob-client/soaptest.py file with correct wsdl. [No escape neeed in the URL]
Prereq: We should have installed python and pipinstall on our laptop to proceed. 
pip install zeep
Execute soaptest.py file to consume the web service as a client. 

# We will try out all these steps in our upcoming lab, and also try out a calculator example.
